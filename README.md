### About This Project
This is an on-going project where I showcase some of the personal stuff that I've been exploring. I built this website mostly out of interest after a four-month coop doing front-end web development. It was designed and build from scratch to be light-weight, easily digestible, with an emphasis on UI/UX design. I had a lot of fun with this one, please check it out!


### Features
- Mobile Friendly 
- Interactive
